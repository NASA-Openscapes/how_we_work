Common practices and approaches to creating open science cloud tutorials

A good resource: https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/jupyter-tips-and-tricks forked from jbwhit:

Prioritize keyboard shortcuts! 

- Esc = deactivate cell (edit mode)
- Ctrl + enter = run cell without advancing
- shift + enter = run cell with advancing
- Ctrl shift + or - will merge or split cells
- J, k, and arrow keys while holding shift: select across multiple cells 
- H brings up the common keyboard shortcuts
- ; “club the output” in python (put at the end of line)
-  Tab to help complete/offer suggestions. 
- Shift-tab shows the signature (the function code/arguments?)
- Shift-tab-tab-tab keeps the menu “sticky”
- Shift-tab-tab-tab-tab opens up documentation (can also do ? before the function)
- Indent / dedent 
- Cmd + [
- Cmd + ]
- Comment/uncomment: Cmd /
- Multiple cursor enabled by holding down Option, then click + drag
- can add underscores in long numbers: 1_000_000 is the same as 1000000 but easier to read
